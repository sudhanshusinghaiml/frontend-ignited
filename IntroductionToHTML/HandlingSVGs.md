# What Are SVGs, and When Should You Use Them?

- First, we need to understand how images work. Common image formats like PNG and JPG are classified as raster formats. 
This essentially means that they are pixel-based, with the data tracking the color value in each pixel.
<br>

- A large downside of raster based images is that they do not upscale well. If you've ever tried to make a PNG larger, 
you may have seen that it becomes pixelated, or blurry.
<br>

- An SVG is a different kind of image. SVG stands for a scalable vector graphic. A vector graphic tracks data based on paths 
and equations to plot points, lines, and curves. What this really means is that a vector graphic, like an SVG, can be scaled 
to any size without impacting the quality.
<br>

- SVGs specifically have the added benefit of storing data in XML. This means you can use them directly in your code as raw HTML 
with the svg element. It also means you can programmatically change the color of the image.
<br>

- To change the smiley face to red, enable the interactive editor and change the `fill="yellow"` to `fill="red"`.

```html
<svg width="100" height="100" viewBox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="45" stroke="black" stroke-width="4" fill="yellow" />
  <circle cx="35" cy="40" r="5" fill="black" />
  <circle cx="65" cy="40" r="5" fill="black" />
  <path d="M35 65 Q50 80 65 65" stroke="black" stroke-width="4" fill="transparent" />
</svg>
```

<br>

- Here are the basic elements for the example:
  - The svg element is the container for the whole drawing. It sets up the space where all the shapes appear. Everything you want to draw with SVG, such as circles, lines, or paths, goes inside the svg element.
  <br>
  - The circle element is used to make the face and the eyes. One large circle forms the yellow face, and two smaller circles make the eyes.
  <br>
  - The path element is used to draw the smile. It creates a curved line for the mouth.
  <br>
  - Each SVG element has attributes that control its appearance and position within the drawing area.
  <br>

- Here are a few more examples. To change the color for any of the examples, update the value for the fill attribute to any named color like red, green, blue, yellow, etc.

```html
<!-- Star Icon -->
<svg width="50" height="50" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="gold" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path d="M12 2L14.9 8.6L22 9.3L17 14.1L18.3 21.2L12 17.8L5.7 21.2L7 14.1L2 9.3L9.1 8.6L12 2Z"/>
</svg>

<!-- Heart Icon -->
<svg width="50" height="50" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="crimson" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path d="M12 21.35L10.55 20.03C5.4 15.36 2 12.28 2 8.5C2 6 4 4 6.5 4C8 4 9.5 4.8 10.5 6.09C11.5 4.8 13 4 14.5 4C17 4 19 6 19 8.5C19 12.28 15.6 15.36 10.45 20.04L12 21.35Z"/>
</svg>

<!-- Checkmark Icon -->
<svg width="50" height="50" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="green" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path d="M20.29 5.71L9 17L3.71 11.71L5.12 10.29L9 14.17L18.88 4.29L20.29 5.71Z"/>
</svg>
```

- So when would you want to use an SVG? A great use case is for icons. 
  - If we want to create custom bullet points, or add icons to our links to represent social media platforms, using SVGs is the best approach. 
  - One of the most popular icon libraries, Font Awesome, uses SVG images for their icons. 
  - SVGs are also great for webpage logos, because they scale perfectly. They allow you to adapt our layout to any responsive design you need. Next time we have an SVG locally, try opening it with a text editor and playing with the code.


### Important Notes:
- How does an SVG store data? as XML
- What is a vector image? An image which stores paths, lines, points, and curves.
- What is a raster image? An image which stores color data for each pixel.
