# HTML Meta and Search Engine Optimization

### What Is the Role of the Meta Description, and How Does It Affect SEO?

- SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is a practice that optimizes web pages so they become more visible and 
rank higher on search engines. One way to improve your site's SEO, is to provide a short description for the 
web page using the meta element. Here is an example of using the meta element to set a page description for a 
gardening site:
```html
<meta
  name="description"
  content="Discover expert tips and techniques for gardening in small spaces, choosing the right plants, 
  and maintaining a thriving garden."
/>
```

- By setting the name attribute to description, it ensures that browsers, search engines, and other web tools 
correctly interpret this metadata. The content attribute is where we will place our description. 
It is recommended that you keep your descriptions short and concise. This is because search engines 
will often truncate the description based on the results page layout.


- Similar to other types of meta elements, the meta description will not be visible on the web page itself. 
One place where the page description can be found is in the search engine results page snippet. 


### The Role of Open Graph Tags, and How Do They Affect SEO

- The open graph protocol enables us to control how our website's content appears across various social media platforms, 
such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and many more. By setting these open graph properties, we can entice users to want to 
click and engage with our content. We can set these properties through a collection of meta elements inside our 
HTML head section.


- The first important OG property to include would be the title. Here is an example of setting the OG title for the 
freeCodeCamp homepage:
```html
<meta content="freeCodeCamp.org" property="og:title" />
```

- For the "property" attribute, you will need to specify that it is "og:title". The content attribute is where you will write 
the title you want displayed for social media sites.


- The next important OG property would be the type. Here is an example of using the OG type for the 
freeCodeCamp homepage:
```html
<meta property="og:type" content="website" />
```

- The type property is used to represent the type of content being shared on social media. Examples of this content include 
articles, websites, videos, or music.


- The third important OG property would be the image. Here is an example of setting the OG image for the freeCodeCamp homepage
```html
<meta
  content="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_meta_1920X1080-indigo.png"
  property="og:image"
/>
```

- In the above example, the open graph image is pointing to the freeCodeCamp logo. All of these images should be high quality with 
good dimensions and ratios. Most social media platforms will include criteria for image requirements to help you ensure that your 
content displays well on their site. For example, the developers.facebook.com documentation page states:

```"use images that are at least 1200 by 630 pixels for the best display on high resolution devices. 
At the minimum, you should use images that are 600 by 315 pixels to display link page posts with larger images."```



- The fourth important OG property would be the url. Here is an example of setting the OG url 
for the freeCodeCamp homepage:
```html
<meta property="og:url" content="https://www.freecodecamp.org" />
```

-There are many more OG properties that we can set, like - description, audio, video and locale. 
However, the open graph url, image, type, and title are the most important ones to include.


- So how do these open graph properties affect Search Engine Optimization? 
When our content is shared on social media, well-crafted OG properties can enhance the appearance for our content in users' feeds. 
This can lead to higher click-through rates which could signal to search engines that your content is relevant and engaging.
